STEM 103 Final Project

Mad Libs Generator

The Mad Libs generator uses a random integer to pick the story, then prompts the user to pick words from pre-made lists,
or type "1" for a random choice to be used from the list. The words are stored as variables to be inserted into the story.
I had to change scope several times, originally planning to learn to build a GUI and allow new inputs from users.
I learned how to bug test, use a random number generator, and create a function to read and call from a list while describing
the list with an input string. The new feature I explored was random, for randomly selecting the story and optionally randomly
selecting words, as well as learning more about using functions to maximize efficiency. I tested using inputs included and not included in the list, as well as an input for random items.
While bug testing I overcame an obstacle with the function and lists by learning about how functions are read by the code and learning that I had accidentally told it to create a list that included the list I wanted to access as the only entry, by unintentionally doubling on brackets. I overcame issues with the GUI Python extension Tkinter not working, by scrapping it from the project and pivoting to an alternate way to build the program.
